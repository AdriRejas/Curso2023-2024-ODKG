    <h1>Dataset Requirements - Group 02</h1>
    
    <p>Requirement 1 -> Data are in the smart cities domain: 
        We believe that the dataset we have chosen satisfies this requirement because 
        we are working with data from the Madrid City Council.
        
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 2 -> Data are available as a CSV file: 
        We believe that the dataset we have selected satisfies this requirement because 
        we have downloaded the dataset in CSV format.
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 3 -> Data have an open license so it can be published: 
        We believe that the dataset we have chosen satisfies this requirement because 
        you can verify the license at the following link:
        <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">License Information</a>
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 4 -> Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations): 
        We believe that the dataset we have selected satisfies this requirement because 
        it contains streets, events, all related to the real world.
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 5 -> Documentation exists for the data:
        The dataset is well documented in a pdf file detailing its structure and columns.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 6 -> Data can come from multiple data sources:
        We are considering datasets for both the cultural activities agenda as well as the cultural centers available in the city
